## Welcome

My name is Nicholas Boyd, and I'm both a web and game developer. [This site](https://nicholas-boyd.github.io) is meant to showcase my projects, and the design process that goes into them.

Here are some of my projects:
- [Project Monster](https://nicholas-boyd.github.io/Project-Monster-Build/): a card based RTS/RPG that uses base card powers and unit stats to determine damage and effects. There is no win condition yet, just have fun attacking stuff
- [Web Hosted Facial Recognition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_2lEoLs9bM): while the site is not currently being hosted, this video shows a project in facial recognition I worked on with OpenFace and OpenCV
- [SJSU Pokemon Club Website](https://nicholas-boyd.github.io/SJSUPokemonClubWebsite/): the website I've developed for the Pokemon Club at SJSU. It's also viewable at its main URL [sjsupokemon.club](https://sjsupokemon.club/)
- [RiskFaktor](https://nicholas-boyd.github.io/RiskFaktor/): originally created as a project for a neighbor whom wanted a website that mimicked the function and look of a slideshow

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/nicholas-boyd/nicholas-boyd.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
