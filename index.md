## Welcome

My name is Nicholas Boyd, and I'm both a web and game developer. [This site](https://nicholas-boyd.github.io) is meant to showcase my projects, and the design process that goes into them.

For something cool to look at while I work on setting things up here, please check out [Project Monster](https://nicholas-boyd.github.io/Project-Monster-Build/): a card based RTS/RPG that uses base card powers and unit stats to determine damage and effects. There is no win condition yet, just have fun attacking stuff!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/nicholas-boyd/nicholas-boyd.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
